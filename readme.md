Welcome to HidApi.Net a modern cross platform C# binding for the C [HIDAPI] library. Supported platforms are Linux, OSX and Windows.

Supported HIDAPI version: Up to 0.14

## Use
To use the library please reference the [nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/HidApi.Net/) in your project. Additionally it is required to either ensure that [HIDAPI] is available on the host system or is distributed as part of your application.

### Code sample
You can use the [Hid class](https://github.com/badcel/HidApi.Net/blob/main/src/HidApi.Net/Hid.cs) to enumerate over devices or directly use the [device class](https://github.com/badcel/HidApi.Net/blob/main/src/HidApi.Net/Device.cs) to connect to a known device:

```csharp
foreach(var deviceInfo in Hid.Enumerate())
{
    using var device = deviceInfo.ConnectToDevice();
    Console.WriteLine(device.GetManufacturer());
}
Hid.Exit(); //Call at the end of your program
```

```csharp
var device = new Device(0x00, 0x00); //Fill vendor id and product id
Console.WriteLine(device.GetManufacturer());
Hid.Exit(); //Call at the end of your program
```

### Linux
In order to access HID devices as an unprivileged user an udev rule must be installed on the host system. Please refer to the sample [udev file][udev] of the [HIDAPI] project.

## Native AOT
If the application targets at least .NET 8 the nuget package allows applications to be published as _Native AOT_ as itself is AOT compatible.

## Build
To build the solution locally execute the following commands:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/badcel/HidApi.Net.git
$ cd HidApi.Net/src
$ dotnet build
```
